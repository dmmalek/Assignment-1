              Coding has been changing the world since it was first invented.
              Back in 1883, the first program language was created. Ada Lovelace
              and Charles Babbage were the first individuals who gave numbers a
              bigger importance than just numerical values.

              Computers don’t have minds of their own…yet. They can act only
              according to the instructions programmed into them. There are
              nearly no industries and social activities untouched by code.
